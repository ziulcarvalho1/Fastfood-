# Forecasting Sales in a Fast-Food Chain

![](https://github.com/ML1000/Assignment-1/blob/master/1.jpg)

In today’s highly competitive and constantly changing business environment, the accurate and timely estimation of future sales, also known as sales prediction or sales forecasting, can offer critical knowledge to companies involved in the manufacturing, wholesale or retail of products. Short-term predictions mainly help in production planning and stock management, while long-term predictions can help in business development decision making. In our specific case, we have a fast-food chain in Brazil with 400 stores with difficulty in predicting its short term production.
Sales prediction is particularly important for this particular company due to the short shelf-life of many of its products, which leads to loss of income in both shortage and surplus situations. Producing too many leads to waste of products, while producing too few leads to opportunity loss. Therefore we have a situation where predicting correctly how much you have to produce each item each day is important.
Moreover, food consumer demand is constantly fluctuating due to factors such as price, promotions, changing consumer preferences or weather changes. Sales prediction is typically done arbitrarily by managers. However, skilled managers are hard to find and they are not always available. In our specific case, this forecast is done based on experience however it remains far from accurate. Average loss (too many or too few) spins around 10%. Here it is important to put the management perspective: It is their view today they rely too much on the managers and would like to have a computer system that can play the role of a skilled manager. Over time the expectation was to have some tool that would free the company from human dependence. In addition, they believe that the level of error is high and could be reduced.
Therefore, from the management perspective, a system capable of predicting the sales would be worth having even if at the beginning it doesn´t perform better than the current process. Equal performance would be acceptable. In addition to that, there was an understanding that the system would be able to improve its performance over time as more and more historical data is added to its reference database.

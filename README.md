Food sales prediction is concerned with estimating future sales of companies in the food industry, such as supermarkets, groceries, restaurants, bakeries and patisseries. Accurate short-term sales prediction allows companies to minimize stocked and expired products inside stores and at the same time avoid missing sales. In order to be able to build a system to predict the demand we have to be able to take design decisions of a data analyst working on food sales prediction, such as the temporal granularity of sales data, the input variables to use for predicting sales and the representation of the sales output variable. In addition, we have to be able to decide which machine learning algorithms suites better food sales prediction and appropriate measures for evaluating their accuracy.
